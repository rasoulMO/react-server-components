This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## What I learned from this project!

It was a great intro to how React server components works in Next.js, and how it's impact on reducing the bundle size by shipping less javascript to the client.
